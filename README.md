`agentlily-runtime` is the execution layer for AgentLily instances in Lily
Protocol, the autonomous agent finance infrastructure being built on Stellar.

This repository is intentionally designed as an open-source-ready runtime
foundation, not a completed runtime product. It provides:

- A modular TypeScript runtime architecture
- One real happy-path execution flow for contributors to study and extend
- Strict typing, tests, linting, and CI scaffolding
- Clear extension points for unfinished systems

## What Exists Today

The current implementation demonstrates a narrow, credible runtime path:

1. Create an `AgentRuntime`
2. Start the runtime and register tools
3. Build a runtime context for a task
4. Execute a task through the task runner and action executor
5. Invoke a typed tool
6. Persist task history in memory or a local JSON file
7. Emit runtime events and structured log entries

This gives contributors a working reference path without locking the project
into premature architecture.

## What Is Intentionally Unfinished

The following areas are scaffolded with interfaces, types, or placeholders and
are expected to become contributor work:

- Wallet-aware and payment-aware actions
- Production-grade persistent memory and state backends
- Model provider integrations (an `OpenAICompatibleModelProvider` scaffold is available for experimentation; note that it is scaffolded and intentionally not production-complete)
- Runtime policy engines and approval flows
- Long-running orchestration and scheduling
- Distributed execution and durable coordination
- Identity-aware execution logic
- Rich tracing, metrics, and production observability

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

Example:

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev"
});

runtime.registerTool({
  name: "echo",
  description: "Returns a string payload for test execution",
  async execute(input) {
    return { echoed: String(input.payload.message ?? "") };
  }
});

await runtime.start();

const result = await runtime.executeTask({
  agentId: "agent-demo",
  taskId: "task-001",
  toolName: "echo",
  input: "Send a greeting",
  payload: { message: "hello lily" }
});

console.log(result.output);
```

## Durable task history

Set `memoryStoragePath` to persist task history to a local JSON file. When no
custom `memoryStore` is supplied, the runtime creates a `JsonFileMemoryStore`
for that path.

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev",
  memoryStoragePath: "./data/task-history.json"
});
```

The file contains a JSON array of `MemoryEntry` objects. Each entry has the
following shape:

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent-demo",
  "taskId": "task-001",
  "input": "Send a greeting",
  "output": { "echoed": "hello lily" },
  "recordedAt": "2026-09-04T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`JsonFileMemoryStore` is intended as a simple local durable backend rather than
a production database. It currently keeps the file contents in memory and
rewrites the full JSON array on each append. It also has no global or per-agent
capacity limit, and multiple writers targeting the same path can overwrite one
another. Use a single writer for a given file and choose a purpose-built storage
backend when stronger concurrency or retention guarantees are required.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` compiles the library
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript in no-emit mode
- `npm run test` runs Vitest with coverage
- `npm run verify` runs formatting, linting, typecheck, and tests

## Contributor Guidance

Good first contributions should add depth without collapsing extension points.
Examples:

- Add a new memory backend that implements `MemoryStore`
- Introduce runtime policies around tool allowlists
- Add an event sink or tracing adapter
- Implement a model provider adapter with tests
- Expand task lifecycle states beyond the current happy path

## Suggested Next Issues

Maintainers can immediately create issues around:

- Provider adapters
- Runtime policies
- Persistent storage
- Wallet-aware execution boundaries
- Observability
- Documentation examples
- Test matrix expansion

The backlog section in the final delivery summary from this setup provides a
ready-made issue starter list.
